Overview:
This repository contains implementations of three tree data structures in Python: Binary Search Tree (BST), Red-Black Tree (RBT), and AVL Tree. Each implementation supports essential operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and inorder traversal.

Features:
Binary Search Tree (BST): A simple structure that maintains order.
Red-Black Tree (RBT): A balanced tree that ensures efficient operations.
AVL Tree: A self-balancing tree that maintains strict balance conditions.

Usage:
Create an instance of the desired tree class.
Insert keys using the insert method.
Delete keys using the delete method.
Search for keys using the search method.
Print keys in sorted order using the inorder method.

Example
To test the implementations, you can run the provided main function, which demonstrates the usage of each tree:
Insert a series of keys.
Perform deletions and searches.
Display the inorder traversal.
